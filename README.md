_Practice using terminal commands and git workflow to find a secret link._

## How to use this activity
The main point is to have students use the command line and the git workflow to find three clues.

The first step is for students to make a `\solution` directory.

Each clue can be found in the _clues directories_ (`\first-clue`, `\second-clue`, `\third-clue`) which they will have to navigate to find.

To start, students will read the `read-me.txt` file provided in each directory which will guide them to finding the clue.

**After each clue is found, students must store them in a designated text file in the created `\solution` directory.**

Once completed, run `script.py` to open the secret link.
